###Interfacing Pygame and Arduino


Once pyserial is installed (http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/pyserial.html) you have the ability to communicate between your python app or python terminal and your Arduino.


The code here is modified version of the pygamecheatsheet.py code with a few simple modifications.

###Major Changes To pygamecheatsheet.py

1. changed  `import pygame, sys` to  `import pygame, sys, serial` on line 9
2. added   `ser = serial.Serial('/dev/tty/usbmodem1421',115200)` on line 13
3. added serial writes via `ser.write('1')` when arrow keys are pressed (see lines 71 - 83)

###ArduinoCode.ino

This code simply has the Arduino detect input written to its serial port, and uses this to figure out where to move.
